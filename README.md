***Remark***: To simplify the process of development, we combine all Lambda related permission policies into one giant Role. It works well so far, but may lead to security concerns.

#### Role Creation
**For the Lambda teams only:** Any policy can be written and attached to roles you create. However, you may only create roles that also have the T1LambdaPermissions policy set as their PermissionBoundary. This ensures that any role you create cannot have more permissions than your account has **REGARDLESS OF THE POLICY ATTACHED**. To do this, ensure that you create the roles needed before the creation of lambdas, and ensure that at the bottom of the creation menu you set the RoleBoundary to T1LambdaPermissions. If you do not do this, you **WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CREATE THE ROLE**.

### S3 Bucket, CloudFront, and Route 53
#### Tutorial
* [Host a Static Site on AWS, using S3 and CloudFront](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/host-static-site-aws-s3-cloudfront/)

#### Buckets
[S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1)
##### [**Host**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/t1-s3-us-east-1/?region=us-east-1)
*Hosting the static website*
##### [**Logs**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/t1-s3-us-east-log/?region=us-east-1)
*Storing CloudFront Logs*
##### [**Images**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/t1-s3-us-east-1-images/?region=us-east-1)
*Storing resumes and other files*
##### [**Storage**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/t1-s3-us-east-1-storage/?region=us-east-1)
*Storing pictures and images*

##### Remark
The [**Host**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/t1-s3-us-east-1/?region=us-east-1) bucket hosts the website. Currently it's open to public to access the website. But since the CloudFront is set up, it could be restrict to only accessed via CloudFront to reach further security.

#### CloudFront
[CloudFront Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home?region=us-east-1#distribution-settings:EGSMGROFKR7F8)

##### Remark
Setting up CloudFront is really easy and straightforward. Be careful ***DO NOT*** use the originally S3 Bucket URL in the default pull down list for `Origin Domain Name`. Please use the website endpoint URL in the "Static Website Hosting" section of the properties in S3 Bucket Console.

#### Route 53
We do not use Route 53 to register the domain, so don't worry about it.


### RDS Database
* [RDS Console](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-2#database:id=postgres;is-cluster=true)
* [DB Schema](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5e97803e39d18f5553fdab5a)

#### Database Schema
*Updated 5/4 10am*  
[Click here for Full Version](https://dbdiagram.io/d/5e97803e39d18f5553fdab5a)
![dbdiagram.io](images/05-04_db_schema.png)

#### Changes
##### 4/29 6pm
* college varchar removed from students table
* recurring_id column added to appointment_block table
* Actually added specialization_for_appointment table to AWS
* supporter_major_preferences and supporter_minor_preferences are now 2 tables instead of 1 combined one

##### 4/29 7am
* added tags relational table instead of storing the tags as a varchar array
* hours_before_appointment stores the time (in hours) before an appointment that supporters prefer to get appointments, this is a new field in supporter_preferences_for_students
* minors have been added to supporter_major_preferences
* in scheduled_appointments, the tags the student selected for the appointment are stored in an int array called â€œselected_tags"
* got rid of job_search in students and supporter_preferences_for_students table
* deleted number of students from appointment_block
* check duration in supporter_specializations is divisible by 5
* specializations_for_appointment relational table added
* check supporter_preferences_for_students_id in supporter_preferences_for_students is equal to supporter_id (the different id is important)
* added team_name for the team a supporter belongs to (varchar)
* got rid of password and salt_key in users
* added student_college relational table
* Added default table (to be used by lambdas as a config file)


### Lambda Functions and API Gateway
* [**Lambda Console**](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-2#/functions)
* [**API Gateway Console**](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home?region=us-east-2#/apis/7jdf878rej/resources/zgbyvb7kf1)

#### Remark
The Back-end teams and Front-end teams are granted with all permission to set up Lambda Functions and API Gateway. And the documentation of integration tests is in [*Low Level Design Document*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HOH07ZS9-GEInBepVvsBIM0y1Hgq3lrCl4xJjspKBGc/edit?usp=sharing).


### Cognito
* [**Cognito Console**](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/users/?region=us-east-2#/pool/us-east-2_TOeWJwIy0/details?_k=9t67ph)

#### Tutorial
* [AWS Cognito Tutorial Part I | Cognito User Pool & AWS Amplify setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaDMG4amEfk&t=1168s)
* [AWS Cognito Tutorial Part II | Sign in & registration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SaO1Pvah2k&t=261s)
* [Cognito Commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cognito-idp/index.html#cli-aws-cognito-idp)

#### Overview
Amazon Cognito is a service that lets you add sign in, sign up and other permission restrictions to a website or mobile app. it was integrated with the website easily and handled complicated steps in the sign-in and sign-up process such as email verification and user authentication. Cognito is easily scalable to more than millions of user and its free tier handles 50,000 monthly active users, which should be enough for ReachOut, but if this number isn't enough, the cost for each monthly active user after 50,000 is only $0.00550.
